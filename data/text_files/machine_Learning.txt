Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn, improve, and make predictions from data without explicit, step-by-step programming. By analyzing large datasets, algorithms identify patterns to create models, with performance enhancing as more data is consumed. 
     Key aspects of machine learning include:
     Core Types:
    Supervised Learning: Algorithms learn from labeled training data to predict outcomes or classify information (e.g., spam detection).
    Unsupervised Learning: Algorithms find hidden patterns or structures in unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation).
    Reinforcement Learning: Agents learn to make decisions by performing actions and receiving rewards or penalties.
    Workflow: Data is collected, preprocessed (cleaned), and fed into an algorithm to train a model, which is then used to make predictions on new data.
    Applications: ML is used extensively in healthcare (disease diagnosis), finance (fraud detection), technology (recommendation engines, chatbots), and computer vision.
